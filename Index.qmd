# Introduction

In this practicum, we explore the transmission dynamics of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in a key wildlife reservoir—the Australian brushtail possum. Once infected, possums remain infectious for life, acting as a persistent source of disease. Transmission occurs through several pathways: direct contact during mating or fighting, indirect contact via shared den sites, and vertical transmission from mother to young while in the pouch.

The possum population is structured into juveniles and adults, with juveniles maturing at a fixed rate regardless of infection status. Population growth is influenced by density-dependent factors, with birth and mortality rates affected by competition for limited resources within home sites. Transmission of infection occurs both through direct contact at a relatively high rate and vertically at a lower rate that depends on population pressure. Infected individuals experience elevated mortality, and after a short latent period, they become infectious for the remainder of their lives.

This model integrates population dynamics and disease transmission to explore the conditions under which TB persists in possum populations, providing a basis for understanding and potentially managing wildlife disease reservoirs.

### Baseline model assumptions

-   **Vertical transmission occurs only from infectious mothers**; exposed (latent) mothers do not transmit the disease to their young.

    -   **Gender is not explicitly modeled** in vertical transmission.

-   **There is no movement or migration between dens**; the home site is treated as a closed population with no external mixing.

-   **Contact rates are uniform across all age groups**, with no preferential mixing or social structure considered.

-   **The transmission rate is assumed to be the same for all types of contact**, with no heterogeneity between individuals or subgroups.

-   **Natural and tuberculosis-induced mortality rates are not age-dependent**; juveniles and adults are subject to the same baseline death rates.

-   **Exposed (latent) individuals do not transmit the disease**, either through contact or vertically.

-   **Asymptomatic transmission is not included** in this model.

Review: per timestep

·       YEAR 0-1: initial increase in Sj due to births and low amount of infected individuals. Fast decrease due to maturation (**can we check where they go**?) ; Sad has exponential growth due to maturing Sj and reaches it’s peak after 1 year; EJ and Ead pick up very slowly in the first year, Ead are double the population size; Iad stays constant until halfway the first year it then increases very slowly. Ij is equal to Ej.

·       YEAR 1-3: Sj decrease slows down due exposure, exposed births and mortality and finds stability around 10 after the second year.; Sad decreases exponentially until the 3^rd^ year due to the infection picking up in both age groups.; Ej slowly picks up and stabilises around 5 after 5 years.; Ead finds its maximum around 5 at 2,5years after which it decreases to 3 around 4,5years.; Ij increases over time and surpasses Sj around 5 years after which it stabilises around 11.; Iad has an exponential increase from 0-2 and slows down between 2 and 4 after which it stabilises around 21.

### Exploring the Initial Increase in $S_J$ (Susceptible Juveniles) {#exploring-the-initial-increase-in-s_j-susceptible-juveniles}

In the baseline simulation, we observe that the number of susceptible juveniles ($S_J$) increases slightly during the first few time steps, despite the presence of processes that remove individuals from this compartment such as infection, maturation, and mortality.

This behavior can be explained by examining the structure of the differential equation governing $S_J$:

$$
\frac{dS_J}{dt} = \lambda X (S_A + E_A) + \lambda X \cdot I_A \cdot (1 - \delta) - (\mu Y + \gamma) S_J - r \beta \left( \frac{I_J}{N_J} + \frac{I_A}{N_A} \right) S_J
$$

Here, $S_J$ increases due to births from susceptible, exposed, and infectious adults (the first two terms), and decreases due to maturation, natural mortality, and transmission (the final three terms).

At the start of the simulation:

-   The infectious compartments $I_J$ and $I_A$ are very small (or zero), so the **force of infection is initially weak**.
-   The number of susceptible adults ($S_A$) is relatively large, contributing to a **high birth input** into the juvenile class.
-   The **birth rate modifier** $X$ is close to 1 early on, since the total population is well below the carrying capacity, making births highly efficient.
-   Losses from $S_J$ due to maturation ($\gamma$) and mortality ($\mu Y$) are moderate, and the population-level modifier $Y$ is still small.

As a result, the influx of newborn susceptibles exceeds the outflows from the compartment in the first few time steps, leading to a brief initial increase in $S_J$. As the simulation progresses, the infectious population grows, the force of infection strengthens, and population pressures increase. This leads to higher losses from $S_J$ through infection, maturation, and density-dependent mortality, eventually reversing the early growth trend.
