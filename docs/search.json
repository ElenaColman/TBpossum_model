    "text": "In this practicum, we explore the transmission dynamics of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in a key wildlife reservoir—the Australian brushtail possum. Once infected, possums remain infectious for life, acting as a persistent source of disease. Transmission occurs through several pathways: direct contact during mating or fighting, indirect contact via shared den sites, and vertical transmission from mother to young while in the pouch.\nThe possum population is structured into juveniles and adults, with juveniles maturing at a fixed rate regardless of infection status. Population growth is influenced by density-dependent factors, with birth and mortality rates affected by competition for limited resources within home sites. Transmission of infection occurs both through direct contact at a relatively high rate and vertically at a lower rate that depends on population pressure. Infected individuals experience elevated mortality, and after a short latent period, they become infectious for the remainder of their lives.\nThis model integrates population dynamics and disease transmission to explore the conditions under which TB persists in possum populations, providing a basis for understanding and potentially managing wildlife disease reservoirs.\n\n\n\nVertical transmission occurs only from infectious mothers; exposed (latent) mothers do not transmit the disease to their young.\n\nGender is not explicitly modeled in vertical transmission.\n\nThere is no movement or migration between dens; the home site is treated as a closed population with no external mixing.\nContact rates are uniform across all age groups, with no preferential mixing or social structure considered.\nThe transmission rate is assumed to be the same for all types of contact, with no heterogeneity between individuals or subgroups.\nNatural and tuberculosis-induced mortality rates are not age-dependent; juveniles and adults are subject to the same baseline death rates.\nExposed (latent) individuals do not transmit the disease, either through contact or vertically.\nAsymptomatic transmission is not included in this model.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical model\n\nModel diagram\nDifferential equations\n\nBaseline infection model\n\nInfection dynamics\nExploring the Initial Increase in S_J\n\nTransmission rate\n\nWhat happens if the transmission rate is dependent on the age groups?\n\nMortality rate\n\nWhat happens if the mortality rate is dependent on age and population culling is introduced?\n\nCarrying capacity\n\nWhat is the effect of the carrying capacity?\n\nAdditional remarks to the model\n\nGroup heterogeneity\nPossible control measures\n\nExtensions of the model\n\nTransmission to multiple den sites\nCross-species transmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase model diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Total births} &= \\lambda X (S_{A} + E_{A} + I_{A}) \\\\\n\\text{Susceptible birth rate} &= \\lambda X (S_{A} + E_{A}) + \\lambda X I_{A}(1 - \\delta) \\\\\n\\text{Exposed birth rate} &= \\lambda X I_{A} \\delta \\\\\n\\frac{dS_J}{dt} &= \\lambda X (S_{A} + E_{A}) + \\lambda X I_{A}(1 - \\delta) - (\\mu Y + \\gamma) S_J - r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_J \\\\\n\\frac{dE_J}{dt} &= \\lambda X I_{A} \\delta + r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_J - (\\mu Y + \\gamma) E_J - \\alpha E_J \\\\\n\\frac{dI_J}{dt} &= \\alpha E_J - (\\mu Y + \\gamma + \\tau) I_J \\\\\n\\frac{dS_A}{dt} &= \\gamma S_J - \\mu Y S_A - r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_A \\\\\n\\frac{dE_A}{dt} &= r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_A + \\gamma E_J - (\\mu Y + \\alpha) E_A \\\\\n\\frac{dI_A}{dt} &= \\gamma I_J + \\alpha E_A - (\\mu Y + \\tau) I_A\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nModel’s parameters {#tableparameters}\n\n\nSymbol\nParameter Name\nExplanation\nValue\n\n\n\n\nλ\nlambda\nPer capita annual birth rate\n5 per year\n\n\nκ\nkappa\nCarrying capacity (max possums per den)\n50\n\n\nρ\nrho\nDimensionless parameter for density effects\n0.5\n\n\nμ\nmu\nNatural mortality rate (population-modified)\n1/5 per year\n\n\nτ\ntau\nTB-induced mortality rate\n1 per year\n\n\nγ\ngamma\nMaturation rate (juveniles to adults)\n1 per year\n\n\nα\nalpha\nLatency rate (exposed to infectious)\n5 per year\n\n\nrβ\nr beta\nContact transmission rate\n2.1 per year\n\n\nδ\ndelta\nVertical transmission rate\n0.1\n\n\n\n\nModel’s modifiers {#tablemodifiers}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nModifier Name\nExplanation\nFormula\n\n\n\n\nY\nMortality modifier\nIncreases mortality with crowding (logistic function)\n\\( Y = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\rho(N_J + N_{Ad} - \\kappa))} \\)\n\n\nX\nBirth rate modifier\nReduces birth rate based on total population\n\\( X = 1 - Y \\)"

Fast decrease due to maturation (can we check where they go?) ; Sad has exponential growth due to maturing Sj and reaches it’s peak after 1 year; EJ and Ead pick up very slowly in the first year, Ead are double the population size; Iad stays constant until halfway the first year it then increases very slowly. Ij is equal to Ej.\n·       YEAR 1-3: Sj decrease slows down due exposure, exposed births and mortality and finds stability around 10 after the second year.; Sad decreases exponentially until the 3rd year due to the infection picking up in both age groups.; Ej slowly picks up and stabilises around 5 after 5 years.; Ead finds its maximum around 5 at 2,5years after which it decreases to 3 around 4,5years.; Ij increases over time and surpasses Sj around 5 years after which it stabilises around 11.; Iad has an exponential increase from 0-2 and slows down between 2 and 4 after which it stabilises around 21.\n·       Idea graph the deaths per group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum population in the baseline model was 55.3570114 possums reached at 0.8 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Initial Increase in \\(S_J\\) (Susceptible Juveniles)\nIn the baseline simulation, we observe that the number of susceptible juveniles (\\(S_J\\)) increases slightly during the first few time steps, despite the presence of processes that remove individuals from this compartment such as infection, maturation, and mortality.\nThis behavior can be explained by examining the structure of the differential equation governing \\(S_J\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dS_J}{dt} = \\lambda X (S_A + E_A) + \\lambda X \\cdot I_A \\cdot (1 - \\delta) - (\\mu Y + \\gamma) S_J - r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_J\n\\]\nHere, \\(S_J\\) increases due to births from susceptible, exposed, and infectious adults (the first two terms), and decreases due to maturation, natural mortality, and transmission (the final three terms).\nAt the start of the simulation:\n\nThe infectious compartments \\(I_J\\) and \\(I_A\\) are very small (or zero), so the force of infection is initially weak.\nThe number of susceptible adults (\\(S_A\\)) is relatively large, contributing to a high birth input into the juvenile class.\nThe birth rate modifier \\(X\\) is close to 1 early on, since the total population is well below the carrying capacity, making births highly efficient.\nLosses from \\(S_J\\) due to maturation (\\(\\gamma\\)) and mortality (\\(\\mu Y\\)) are moderate, and the population-level modifier \\(Y\\) is still small.\n\nAs a result, the influx of newborn susceptibles exceeds the outflows from the compartment in the first few time steps, leading to a brief initial increase in \\(S_J\\). As the simulation progresses, the infectious population grows, the force of infection strengthens, and population pressures increase. This leads to higher losses from \\(S_J\\) through infection, maturation, and density-dependent mortality, eventually reversing the early growth trend."

Instead of using a single uniform transmission rate across all age groups, we introduced three distinct contact rates to reflect behavioral differences with following transmission rate values:\n\nJuvenile-to-juvenile transmission (e.g., through play and nesting interactions): \\(r_{\\beta 1}\\)\nAdult-to-adult transmission (e.g., through breeding and fighting): \\({r_\\beta 2}\\)\nCross-age transmission between juveniles and adults (less frequent interaction): \\(r_{\\beta 3}\\)\n\nThese values allow us to explore how increased transmission among adults (e.g., due to aggressive behaviors) might influence infection dynamics in the overall population, and how juvenile–adult interactions contribute to disease spread."

    "text": "While the current model simulates TB dynamics within a single possum den, real-world populations are spatially structured. Extending the model to multiple dens would allow for a more realistic representation of disease spread across a landscape.\nTo implement this, we would:\n\nDuplicate compartmental structures for each den (e.g., \\(S_{J1}\\), \\(E_{J1}\\), \\(I_{J1}\\) for den 1, and so on).\nIntroduce between-den transmission, governed by a new parameter (e.g., \\(\\beta_{\\text{between}}\\)), representing low-probability contact between individuals from different dens.\nInclude age-dependent migration between dens. Migration could be modeled as:\n\nPrimarily occurring in adults, reflecting territorial expansion or dispersal behavior.\nParameterized by a migration rate \\(\\mu_{\\text{mig}}\\) for adults, influencing transitions like \\(S_{A1} \\rightarrow S_{A2}\\)\n\n\nThis spatial extension would allow exploration of local outbreaks, pathogen persistence, and the impact of targeted control strategies (e.g., selective culling or vaccination in high-prevalence dens).\n\n\n\n\nThe current model assumes a birth rate of 5/year across all adults. However, female brushtail possums typically have only one offspring per year.\n\nUpdating the model to include sex structure or a reduced per capita birth rate could improve biological realism.\nTo explore high-density scenarios, it may be useful to simulate outcomes under higher birth rates, assessing whether rapid population turnover increases or suppresses TB transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough some simulations incorporated different mortality rates for juveniles and adults, this could be refined further with age-specific survival curves or seasonal survival shifts, reflecting real-world ecological pressures (e.g., food scarcity, predation).\n\n\n\nThe role of possums as vectors of bovine TB to cattle has major implications for New Zealand’s livestock industry. Future extensions could incorporate:\n\nA second host population (e.g., cattle), with its own compartments (e.g., \\(S_C\\), \\(E_C\\), \\(I_C\\)).\nCross-species transmission terms, possibly via shared environments (e.g., contaminated pasture) or aerosol pathways.\nBuilding on models such as that by Phepa et al. (2016) for TB dynamics in cattle and bison, incorporating interaction rates and interspecies transmission coefficients."

    "text": "Common brushtail possums represent a key reservoir of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in New Zealand. Transmission occurs due to living in close proximity in dens, fighting, mating, and vertical transmission. Possum culling programs and the creation of wildlife management areas have attempted to reduce the impact of TB on the nation’s dairy industry, with varying success.\nThis paper presents a mathematical model investigating the epidemic and disease dynamics of bovine TB in one den with 50 possums (30 adults and 20 juveniles) into which one infected individual is introduced. While the compartmental model (see below) includes heterogeneity between adults and juveniles a number of assumptions are made based on the information provided:\n\nmortality is assumed to be the same for adults and juveniles,\nthe contact transmission rate is the same for all contacts,\nvertical transmission to juvenile possums is not limited to females,\ntransmission does not occur during the latent period and there is no asymptomatic transmission, and\nthe den is a closed population, with no possums entering or leaving the den other than the first infected individual.\nThe birth rate differs between susceptible and exposed juveniles as only infected adults can birth exposed juveniles.\n\nA table of the parameters and modifiers is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase model diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Total births} &= \\lambda X (S_{A} + E_{A} + I_{A}) \\\\\n\\text{Susceptible birth rate} &= \\lambda X (S_{A} + E_{A}) + \\lambda X I_{A}(1 - \\delta) \\\\\n\\text{Exposed birth rate} &= \\lambda X I_{A} \\delta \\\\\n\\frac{dS_J}{dt} &= \\lambda X (S_{A} + E_{A}) + \\lambda X I_{A}(1 - \\delta) - (\\mu Y + \\gamma) S_J - r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_J \\\\\n\\frac{dE_J}{dt} &= \\lambda X I_{A} \\delta + r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_J - (\\mu Y + \\gamma) E_J - \\alpha E_J \\\\\n\\frac{dI_J}{dt} &= \\alpha E_J - (\\mu Y + \\gamma + \\tau) I_J \\\\\n\\frac{dS_A}{dt} &= \\gamma S_J - \\mu Y S_A - r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_A \\\\\n\\frac{dE_A}{dt} &= r \\beta \\left( \\frac{I_J}{N_J} + \\frac{I_A}{N_A} \\right) S_A + \\gamma E_J - (\\mu Y + \\alpha) E_A \\\\\n\\frac{dI_A}{dt} &= \\gamma I_J + \\alpha E_A - (\\mu Y + \\tau) I_A\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nModel’s parameters {#tableparameters}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nParameter Name\nExplanation\nValue\nUnit\n\n\n\n\nλ\nlambda\nPer capita annual birth rate\n5\nper year\n\n\nκ\nkappa\nCarrying capacity\n50\npossums per den\n\n\nρ\nrho\nDimensionless parameter for density effects\n0.5\n(Dimensionless)\n\n\nμ\nmu\nNatural mortality rate (population-modified)\n1/5\nper year\n\n\nτ\ntau\nTB-induced mortality rate\n1\nper year\n\n\nγ\ngamma\nMaturation rate (juveniles to adults)\n1\nper year\n\n\nα\nalpha\nLatency rate (exposed to infectious)\n5\nper year\n\n\nrβ\nr beta\nContact transmission rate\n2.1\nper year\n\n\nδ\ndelta\nVertical transmission rate\n0.1\nper birth\n\n\n\n\nModel’s modifiers {#tablemodifiers}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol\nModifier Name\nExplanation\nFormula\n\n\n\n\nY\nMortality modifier\nIncreases mortality with crowding (logistic function)\n\\( Y = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\rho(N_J + N_{Ad} - \\kappa))} \\)\n\n\nX\nBirth rate modifier\nReduces birth rate based on total population\n\\( X = 1 - Y \\)"

This results in rapid growth in the susceptible adult population, which peaks after the first year.\nThe number of exposed individuals increases slowly during the first year, while the number of infected adults remains constant for the first 6 months before gradually increasing. In the following three years, the rate of increase in susceptible juveniles slows due to mortality, and an increase in the number of exposed juveniles. The number of susceptible adults decreases after the third year due to the increasing number of infected possums. The number of exposed juveniles stabilizes at around 5 after 5 years, while the number of exposed adults reaches a maximum of 5 after 2.5 years and decreases to 3 after 4.5 years. The number of infected juveniles continues to increase and surpasses the number of susceptible juveniles at 5 years, before stabilizing at a population of 11. The number of infected adults grows exponentially in the first two years before stabilizing at around 21 adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum population in the baseline model was 55 possums reached at 1 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the population stabilises, at the end of 6 years, approximately 8 possums die per year due to natural causes and 31 due to TB."
