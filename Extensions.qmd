# Extensions to the model {#extensions-of-the-model}

## Transmission across multiple den sites {#transmission-to-multiple-den-sites}

While the current model simulates TB dynamics within a single possum den, real-world populations are spatially structured. **Extending the model to multiple dens** would allow for a more realistic representation of disease spread across a landscape.

To implement this, we would:

-   **Duplicate compartmental structures** for each den (e.g., $S_{J1}$, $E_{J1}$, $I_{J1}$ for den 1, and so on).

-   Introduce **between-den transmission**, governed by a new parameter (e.g., $\beta_{\text{between}}$), representing low-probability contact between individuals from different dens.

-   Include **age-dependent migration** between dens. Migration could be modeled as:

    -   Primarily occurring in **adults**, reflecting territorial expansion or dispersal behavior.

    -   Parameterized by a migration rate $\mu_{\text{mig}}$ for adults, influencing transitions like $S_{A1} \rightarrow S_{A2}$

This spatial extension would allow exploration of **local outbreaks**, **pathogen persistence**, and the impact of **targeted control strategies** (e.g., selective culling or vaccination in high-prevalence dens).

## Demographic Refinements

-   The current model assumes a birth rate of 5/year across all adults. However, **female brushtail possums typically have only one offspring per year**.

    -   Updating the model to include **sex structure** or a **reduced per capita birth rate** could improve biological realism.

    -   To explore high-density scenarios, it may be useful to simulate outcomes under **higher birth rates**, assessing whether rapid population turnover increases or suppresses TB transmission.

## Age-Dependent Mortality

Although some simulations incorporated different mortality rates for juveniles and adults, this could be **refined further** with **age-specific survival curves** or **seasonal survival shifts**, reflecting real-world ecological pressures (e.g., food scarcity, predation).

## Cross-species transmission {#cross-species-transmission}

The **role of possums as vectors of bovine TB to cattle** has major implications for New Zealand’s livestock industry. Future extensions could incorporate:

-   A **second host population** (e.g., cattle), with its own compartments (e.g., $S_C$, $E_C$, $I_C$).

-   **Cross-species transmission terms**, possibly via shared environments (e.g., contaminated pasture) or aerosol pathways.

-   Building on models such as that by **Phepa et al. (2016)** for TB dynamics in cattle and bison, incorporating interaction rates and interspecies transmission coefficients.
