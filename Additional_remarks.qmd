# Additional remarks to the model {#additional-remarks-to-the-model}

## Group heterogeneity {#group-heterogeneity}

The model accounts for heterogeneity by distinguishing between juvenile and adult possums, allowing for different infection and mortality dynamics across age groups. While maturation and birth dynamics are age-specific, other simplifying assumptions—such as homogeneous mixing and fixed transition rates—are maintained to keep the model tractable.

## Possible control measures {#possible-control-measures}

![Mortality dependent on age groups](www/Changeinmortalityrate.png)

Culling has been widely implemented in New Zealand as a strategy to control bovine tuberculosis (TB) in wildlife. One field trial reported TB elimination in both possums and cattle after reducing possum population density by 78% (Nugent et al., 2015).

To simulate this, we introduced a **culling rate of 80%** into the model **as an additive term to the natural mortality for adults**. This effectively increases mortality across infected and uninfected adults, mimicking real-world management interventions.

Under this scenario, the total population declined only slightly over 10 years, but disease dynamics shifted notably. The number of susceptible juveniles increased and stabilized later, while susceptible adults also rose and plateaued at a higher level. Exposed compartments remained similar in shape but with flatter curves. Infections were notably reduced: the number of infected juveniles dropped by half, and infected adults declined from 21 to 14. TB mortality fell from 35 to 29 deaths, driven primarily by reductions in adult cases. Natural mortality increased due to the added culling pressure, stabilizing at 24 deaths per year.

    To assess the broader impact of management strategies, the model was extended with an interactive slider that allows exploration of culling rates from 0% to 100%. The tool highlights how even moderate adjustments to culling rates can shape long-term disease outcomes and demographic structure.
